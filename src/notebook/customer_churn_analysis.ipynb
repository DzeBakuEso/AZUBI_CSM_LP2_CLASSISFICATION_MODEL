    "Customer attrition is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. Customer churn otherwise known as customer attrition or customer turnover is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service within a specified timeframe.\n",
    "For instance, if you began the year with 500 customers but later ended with 480 customers, the percentage of customers that left would be 4%. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.\n",

    "In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem."

    "# The project aims to achieve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Understanding and Preprocessing:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the provided data, ensuring its quality and suitability for building classification models. Cleanse and preprocess the data to address any issues and prepare it for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis to unveil insights into customer churn patterns. Identify distribution patterns, correlations, and potential data challenges that may impact the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering:** Select relevant features from the dataset and engineer new features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities. Transform the data into a format that maximizes the model's accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection and Evaluation:** Evaluate multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the most suitable model for predicting customer churn. Use appropriate evaluation metrics to compare model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Deployment:** Deploy the final classification model to enable real-time predictions on new customer data. Develop a user-friendly interface or API for seamless integration with the company's existing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful completion of the project, the company will have a well-documented and deployed machine learning model capable of accurately predicting customer churn in real-time. This predictive tool will empower the company to proactively take measures to retain valuable customers and make informed business decisions."
